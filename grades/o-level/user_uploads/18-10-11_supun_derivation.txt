Every < form > element should carry at least two attributes:
action 
 method
action : The action attribute indicates what has to be done to the submitted data (instructions should be given using server side scripting language like PHP ASP etc).
E.g. <form action=”script/login.php” >
 login.php is the file consisting instructions written in PHP located in the script folder
method Attribute
Form data can be sent to the server in two ways an HTTP method :
 get method, which sends data as part of the URL(visible to everyone)
 post method, which hides data in something known as the HTTP headers(variables are not displayed in the URL. sending passwords or other sensitive information.)
id Attribute
id attribute allows you to uniquely identify the < form > element within a page
Style sheets and scripts  use this id attribute to identify the form
Good practice : start with frm and relevant name
 eg. frmLogin or frmSearch
